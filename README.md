## Overview
CyberFrat Password Manager is a secure and innovative tool designed to help you generate unique, secure passwords for your online accounts—without storing your original password. Inspired by the 2022 LastPass security breach, our solution addresses the risks of centralized password storage and weak master passwords, allowing you to use a single master password while ensuring that each website gets a distinct, strong password.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Extension:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/mattgwin29/hackathon-2025.git
     ```

2. **Install the Extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/).
   - Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the upper-right corner).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you downloaded or extracted the extension.

3. **Log In:**
   - Open the extension and log in using OAuth

4. **Generate and Retrieve Your Password:**
   - Visit any website with a login required.
   - Enter your master password (the one you always use).
   - The secured password will be autofilled inside the password box.**without us storing it**.



## Future Plans
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Develop an app and a web interface to provide seamless usability across different devices.
- **Enhanced Features:** Continuously improve security and user experience based on feedback and emerging technologies.
- **User-Centric Enhancements:** Integrate more customization options and additional security measures to meet diverse user needs.
